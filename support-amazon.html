    Support OSM when you shop AmazonSmile, a special website operated by Amazon that makes donations to charitable organizations selected by its customers. It's easy. Visit the AmazonSmile website "http://smile.amazon.com" and enter "Orchestra Santa Monica" to specify our group as your recipient charity. Be sure to bookmark the AmazonSmile website, then do all of your Amazon shopping at AmazonSmile and OSM will receive 0.5% of your eligible purchases. :-)
