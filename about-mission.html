  <h1>Mission &amp; Background</h1>

  <p>
    OSM Mission: To build a strong community of classical music lovers of all ages and make a positive impact on the quality of peopleâ€™s lives. To nurture young people, OSM involves children and teens at our orchestra concerts as volunteers, audience goers, and performers and holds engaging musical outreach programs at local schools and community centers. To serve the community at large, OSM creates and shares life-enriching experiences through accessible, educational and inspirational live performances of classical music.
  </p>

  <p>
    Background: Founded in the Fall of 2012, OSM performs four full orchestra concerts per year. The orchestra keeps its musical programming varied, presenting both standard repertoire and less-traditional works, and introducing culturally-diverse composers and soloists as well as new and exciting contemporary pieces.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to our four primary orchestra concerts, smaller OSM ensembles perform at a variety of locations throughout Santa Monica and the Westside. Many of these smaller performances are geared toward outreach, education, and cultural enrichment while others are programmed for pure entertainment and enjoyment. Please read about a few of our outside activities below. These activities, along with our four orchestra concerts, are an example of what OSM accomplishes in a single season, so as you can see we are very busy within the community. We hope you will join us in our various forms of music making!

    <h2>OSM Educational Talks and Performances at Local Schools</h2>

    <p>
      The OSM Woodwind Quintet performs in-school concerts every year at Title I schools whose students have little access to live concert music. By incorporating educational talks into each performance, the quintet enhances the learning experience for younger audiences and helps introduce them to new or unfamiliar genres.

      The OSM Winds, performing a lovely Mozart Serenade, entertained a large group of guests at a special event honoring John Bohn at the Fairmont Miramar Hotel. Prior to this, an OSM string quartet delighted the audience with its wonderful playing and set the tone for a fabulous, elegant evening. John Bohn, beloved and respected for his many years of service to the Santa Monica community, was presented with OSM's first Virtuoso Community Leader Award.
