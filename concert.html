  <h2>Concerts for the 2015-16 season</h2>
  <h3>Welcome to OSM!</h3>

  <p>
    Concerts take on a new dimension when you're close to the action. For our 2015-2016 season, OSM will be performing all our concerts(*) in the intimacy and superb acoustics of the Ann and Jerry Moss Theater located in The Herb Alpert Educational Village at New Roads School. We hope you will enjoy the wonderful ambience, comfort, and viewing perspectives of this new 344-seat state-of-the-art venue. With acoustics designed by Yasuhisa Toyota (acoustician for Disney Hall), your live musical experience will be especially enhanced. For more information visit <a href="http://www.mosstheater.com/" target="_blank">Moss Theater</a>.

    Futhermore, OSM concerts at the Moss come with free and convenient on-site and near-by street parking â€¦ a real bonus in our area! And for those of you interested in taking advantage of the Expo line extension opening on May 20, 2016, the Bergamot Station light rail stop at 26th/Olympic is just a short 10 minute walk to the Moss Theater.
