    Orchestra Santa Monica believes in the future of classical music and proudly nurtures the community’s interest in live concert music. In addition to its full symphony orchestra, OSM provides smaller music ensembles (e.g., quintets, quartets, trios, duos) for a wide range of events using its highly experienced pool of musicians.

    The OSM Woodwind Quintet is a cornerstone in Orchestra Santa Monica’s educational and community outreach. A large portion of the quintet’s focus is to provide live music programs to schools, local churches, and neighborhood organizations. The quintet often performs in Title I schools, whose students have little access to live concert music. By incorporating educational talks into each performance, the quintet enhances the learning experience for younger audiences and helps introduce them to new or unfamiliar genres.

    “We are very fortunate to have the OSM Woodwind Quintet.   As the educational arm of the orchestra, they foster a growing music community.” – Maestro Gross
