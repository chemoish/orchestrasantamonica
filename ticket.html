  <h2>Purchase tickets for the 2015-16 season</h2>

  <p>
    All concerts are General Admission with open seating. OSM offers special pricing for seniors (65 and above), full-time college students (with valid student ID), and younger students through Grade 12. On-line ticket purchases are available for your convenience and can be made securely using PayPal. You may use PayPal as a "guest" and pay by entering your standard credit card information. Or, if you already have a PayPal account, you can login as normal and make your payment.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your order name will be on our pre-paid ticket list, but you may want to also bring your PayPal receipt to the concert as your proof of purchase to pick up your ticket(s) at the Will Call Desk. Tickets may be selected from the options below.
