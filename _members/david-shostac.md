“Extraordinary, dazzling, world class” and “a musician of the highest order” are words critics have used to describe the artistry of David Shostac. Principal Flute with the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra since 1975 and Principal Flute of Orchestra Santa Monica, Dave has performed as a solo and orchestral player at the Hollywood Bowl and has taken part in the Ojai, Mostly Mozart, Aspen and Oregon Bach festivals. Recent solo appearances with the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra include the premiere of his Carmen Fantasy for flute and orchestra in 2009.

Dave’s most recent recording, Vivaldi Flute Concertos with the Song of the Angels Flute Orchestra, features several of his original arrangements, accompanied by a unique orchestra consisting entirely of flutes of all sizes, including bass, contrabass and double contrabass flutes. Other recordings include Chamber Music Classics for Flute JS Bach: The Six Flute Sonatas, and The Romantic Flute.

Dave is active in the motion picture recording industry and can be heard on hundreds of motion picture soundtracks. His expanding list of credits includes Avatar, The Karate Kid and many others. He has taught at USC, UCLA, the California Institute of the Arts, the Aspen Music School and the Idyllwild Arts Academy. He is currently a faculty member of CSU Northridge.
