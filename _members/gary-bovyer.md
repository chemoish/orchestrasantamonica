In addition to his position as OSM Principal Clarinet, Gary Bovyer is principal of the Long Beach Symphony, the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, and the Los Angeles Master Chorale Sinfonia. As Mark Swed wrote in the Los Angeles Times of his playing; "...the clarinet, exquisitely played by Gary Bovyer, reached such a degree of quiet tenderness that the ending felt more like a mystical breeze lightly touching the skin than sound waves striking the ear." The Long Beach Gazette said of his 2006 performance with the Long Beach Symphony, ” Quiet perfection marked the Mozart (Basset) Clarinet Concerto as performed by Gary Bovyer…the perfection came from the balance, the musicality, the just-right tempos and the sense of total authority. Bovyer was poised, his sound creamy and luscious…what came through was fabulous Mozart, in all its glory.”

An active clarinetist in the Los Angeles recording studios for over 25 years, Gary can be heard as principal clarinetist on several of the motion picture scores of James Horner, Danny Elfman, David Newman and George Clinton.

Recently Gary recorded Steve Reich's "The Daniel Variations" on Nonesuch and is also featured in James Newton's "Sacred Music" on New World Records. He is the co-director of the Long Beach Symphony's chamber music and architecture series, "Sounds & Spaces" and is on the faculty at Pomona College, Claremont.
