In addition to Orchestra Santa Monica, Mr. Emery is Concertmaster and a frequent soloist with the Catskill, Schenectady, and Glens Falls Symphonies in upstate New York. Mr. Emery has performed as soloist and concertmaster in several major European cities in summer concert tours with the Santa Monica Chamber Philharmonia.

Mr. Emery is on faculty and a performing artist with the Luzerne Music Festival, and was invited to teach at the Mahler Conservatory of Music in Vienna this past summer.

As Senior Artist-in-Residence at Skidmore College, Mr. Emery directs the expanding string department, working with talented students on solo, chamber music, and orchestral repertoire.
