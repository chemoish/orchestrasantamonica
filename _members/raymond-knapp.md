Professor Raymond Knapp (violin) has taught in the Department of Musicology at UCLA since 1989 and is a member of OSM’s second violin section. Knapp plays the violin both for the joy of it and as a “reality check” for his teaching and research. He has authored four books, including Symphonic Metamorphoses: Subjectivity and Alienation in Mahler’s Re-Cycled Songs and the award-winning The American Musical and the Formation of National Identity and has co-edited two others. His published essays address a wide range of additional interests, including Beethoven, Wagner, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, nationalism, musical allusion, music and identity, and film music. To our delight, OSM musicians and concert-goers are treated to Knapp’s colorful and insightful program notes each concert.

Knapp gained his early playing experience in his home-town and university orchestras (Grand Forks, North Dakota and Harvard, respectively), then was a longtime player for the Santa Monica Symphony before joining Orchestra Santa Monica. On the side, he has become an avid biker, trailing after his even more avid biker spouse. Together they have participated (along with several thousand others) in Levi’s Granfondo in Sonoma County.
